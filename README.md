# Simon Says

**Description**:<br>
This is a simple javascript game, where an alert box shows the user **5 random numbers**.<br>
After the user tries to memorize the numbers and clicks '**ok**', a countdown from 30 to 0 starts.<br>
When the countdown expires the user should try to input the numbers he saw before the countdown, and if more than one number is guessed correctly the game returns the numbers guessed.<br>
If the player doesn't guess any of the numbers a message is shown.
